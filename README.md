# sway-config
This repo hosts my sway configuration and a small bash script for the status bar.

## Sway configuration

Here are the changes made to the initial sway configuration :

 * Change the mod button to Alt
 * Change background and lock background
 * Change position of dmenu bar
 * Change keyboard layout
 * Add binds for multimedia buttons
 * Change gaps
 * Natural scrolling
 * Add shortcuts for screenshots


## Status bar

This status bar is very simple. It is not very efficient and not very customisable (see waybar for more options) but KISS.

It prints :

 * Login@hostname
 * Current WiFi network
 * Current screen luminosity
 * Current sound volume
 * Current mic volume
 * Current CPU usage
 * Current RAM usage
 * Uptime
 * Version of linux kernel
 * Battery percentage
 * Date and time

## Warning

Please note that some instructions in this repo are really specific to my infrastructure.
